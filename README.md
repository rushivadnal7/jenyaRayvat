I used redux-toolkit(for state management) , styled-component (for css styling) , axios(for API fetching) , react-router-dom(for routing in react) and react hooks like useCallback , useEffect , useState.
i faced difficulties in API because the API is not working i guess . 
and one more thing that i am newly using Redux in my projects i use context API for state management across the component.
I worked in component-based architecture.
